            <div class="picture">
            <img src="./images/Photo.png" alt="">
            <p>This photo web is a simple and creative project built using HTML and CSS. It serves as a digital gallery where I display images that reflect my personality, interests, and creativity. The website was fully designed and coded by me as part of my learning journey at Moringa School.

                The goal of this project was to practice building a clean and visually appealing website while improving my understanding of web structure, styling, and layout. Each part of the site was created from scratch to help me grow as a web developer</p>

    <h4>MY BIOGRAGHY</h4>
    <div class="picture">
    <img src="./images/my pic.jpg" style="width:150px;"alt="">
    <p>Hi, I’m Mohamed Bishar, an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for creating powerful and user-friendly websites. I’m currently sharpening my skills at Moringa School, where I’m building a strong foundation in HTML,JavaScript and CSS, and growing every day as a coder.

        What started as a simple curiosity has turned into a deep love for coding. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean design, well-structured code, and a constant desire to learn and improve. My goal is to master both the front-end and back-end of web development, becoming a full-stack developer who can build complete, high-quality applications from start to finish.
        
        Whether I’m solving bugs or designing a layout, I put my creativity and focus into everything I code. This portfolio is a reflection of my journey — with each project showing the steps I'm taking toward becoming a professional developer.</p>
